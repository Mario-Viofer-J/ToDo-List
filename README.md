# ToDo List  

A simple **ToDo List Web App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This is a **personal practice project** created to improve frontend development skills.  

---

## Features  

- Add new tasks with a due date  
- Display tasks in a clean, tabular format  
- Delete tasks individually  
- Keyboard shortcut: press **Enter** to quickly add a task  
- Minimal and responsive UI with background styling  

---

## How It Works  

1. Enter a task name and select a date.  
2. Click **ADD** or press **Enter** to add the task.  
3. Tasks appear in a table with a **Delete** button.  
4. Clicking **Delete** removes that specific task.  

> Note: Tasks are stored in memory, so they reset when the page is refreshed.
